# Walmart Sales Analysis - PowerBI Project
This project presents an in-depth analysis of Walmart sales data using PowerBI. The analysis involves cleaning raw data from an Excel sheet, summarizing key sales insights, and forecasting future sales and profit trends. The results are presented in an interactive PowerBI dashboard with several visualizations and metrics, which help in understanding Walmart’s sales performance across different dimensions.

## Overview

In this project, we analyzed Walmart’s sales data using PowerBI, starting from raw Excel data. The primary objective was to clean the data by removing any noisy or irrelevant entries and then generate useful insights that can aid decision-making. The analysis was split into three pages in PowerBI:
- **Page 1 (Summary Page)**: A high-level summary of the data, including key statistics like total sales, total profit, and other high-level metrics.
- **Page 2 (Detailed Forecasts)**: A more detailed analysis, including:
  - Forecasted sales and profit.
  - Monthly sales summary.
  - Yearly quality analysis.
  - Sales by category and profit by category.
- **Page 3 (Detailed Insights)**: A more detailed analysis, including:
  - Top 10 customers and top 10 products by sales.
  - Total sales by state.

## About the Project

### Data Cleaning:
The project starts by importing the raw Walmart sales data from an Excel sheet. We removed any noisy data points, such as incomplete records or irrelevant columns, to focus on key attributes like sales, profit, product categories, and customer details.

### Analysis and Visualizations:
Once the data was cleaned, PowerBI was used to create several interactive visualizations that help uncover valuable insights. The analysis includes:
- **Forecasting**: Predicting future sales and profit based on historical trends.
- **Summarization**: Aggregating sales and profits by various dimensions such as month, year, category, and state.
- **Top Performers**: Analyzing the top 10 customers and products by sales volume.


## Conclusion

The Walmart Sales Analysis project using PowerBI provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance. By cleaning the raw data and performing various aggregations and forecasts, the project helps to identify key patterns in sales, top-performing customers, and products, as well as geographical sales insights. This analysis can be used by Walmart’s management to optimize inventory, marketing, and sales strategies.

By leveraging PowerBI's powerful data visualization and forecasting capabilities, this project aims to enhance decision-making processes with actionable insights derived from past data and future predictions.
